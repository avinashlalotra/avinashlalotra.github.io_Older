## 🧠 Welcome to Low-Level Quest
Hi, I’m Abinash Singh — a curious explorer of the low-level world of computers. This blog is my personal lab notebook where I document my hands-on journey through:

### 🧬 Open-source hardware

### 💻 Linux kernel hacking & device drivers

### 🔩 Bare-metal programming & embedded systems

### 🧰 RTL design & custom SoCs

### 🛠️ RISC-V experiments & core bring-up

Whether it's writing your first kernel patch, booting a custom RISC-V CPU on an FPGA, or lighting up LEDs from assembly, I’m here to share the learning process — raw, unfiltered, and full of trial and error.

🔍 What to expect
This blog will feature:

Deep-dives into Linux contributions, especially in kernel subsystems

Tutorials on writing and debugging device drivers

Step-by-step SoC bring-ups and hardware/software co-design

Practical lessons from RTL projects and FPGA exploration

Insights from working with tools like Verilog, Vivado, elf2hex, open-source toolchains, and more

If you enjoy tinkering, debugging at the lowest levels, or contributing to real-world systems, you’ll probably find something valuable here.
